# Fetch
Pet owners find local pet sitters and pet sitters find pet owners in need of a sitter. 

## Technologies used:
Angular, Rails API, Angular-filter, jQuery, HTML5, CSS

## Overview:
We created a pet sitter web application where where a pet owner can locate a pet sitter and a pet sitter can locate a pet. We have three models (pet sitter, pet owner and pet) with pet owner and pet having a one to many relationship.
In our application a pet owner is able to search for pet sitters by name and location(zipcode) by using a text search or a drop down list. A pet sitter is able to search by location and type of pet. We also included a filter to include or not include a pet that will need to be given medication.
